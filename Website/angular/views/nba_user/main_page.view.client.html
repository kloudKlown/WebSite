        <p>
            Daily Fantasy blogging for NBA is a challenging task which requires a lot of effort. The authors have to keep up to date with current stats for the players, injury reports,
            projections, head-to-head stats, narratives etc., on a good day. After following NBA blogging for 3 months we identified four of the top free DFS bloggers for NBA.
        </p>

        <p> However, these blogs can run upto 1500-3000 words long and it is difficult to reach a consensues about which player is good according to all bloggers.
            Hence, to consolidate the blogs and to save time we have implemented a technique to group all the opinions and rate the sentiments of each blogger.
        </p>

        <p>
            We use <b>Sentiment analysis</b> to rate each player based on the sentiments of the various reputed bloggers. Using <b>VADER</b> (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), we
            calculate the sentiment score for the players being discussed. VADER is a lexicon and rule based sentiment analysis tool which is used by researchers for analysing sentiments expressed
            in social media sources.
        </p>

        <p>
            As VADER does not deal with NBA jargon in general, we used a modified version of VADER tool, using updated lexicon and idioms for this analysis of sport sentiment.
            It's still in experimental stages and the values associated with jargons are being updated and new words added everyday. To learn more visit my Git repo.

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.fantasybasketball101.com/dfs-beginners-guide-start/">Daily Fantasy</a>
            blogging for NBA is a challenging task which requires a lot of effort. The authors have to keep
            up to date with current stats for the players, injury reports,
            projections, head-to-head stats, narratives etc., on a good day. After following NBA blogging for
            3 months we identified four of the top free DFS bloggers for NBA.
        </p>

        <p> However, these blogs can run upto 1500-3000 words long and it is difficult to reach a consensues about which player is good according to all bloggers.
            Hence, to consolidate the blogs and to save time we have implemented a technique to group all the opinions and rate the sentiments of each blogger.
        </p>

        <p>
            We use <b>Sentiment analysis</b> to rate each player based on the sentiments of the various reputed bloggers. Using <b>VADER</b> (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), we
            calculate the sentiment score for the players being discussed. VADER is a lexicon and rule based sentiment analysis tool which is used by researchers for analysing sentiments expressed
            in social media sources.
        </p>

        <p>
            As VADER does not deal with NBA jargon in general, we used a modified version of VADER tool, using updated lexicon and idioms for this analysis of sport sentiment.
            It's still in experimental stages and the values associated with jargons are being updated and new words added everyday. To learn more visit my Git repo.

            <p>
                NBA API contains cleaned data for NBA enthusiasts and sports geeks to easily download and use NBA data.
                The API currently has data starting from NBA 2014 season till 2016. The current season will be put up shortly
                and updated daily after the games. The API itself is free to use and parameters for the API have been explained.

        <p>
            Prediction are the primary aspect of DFS. Our modelers are built using a array of sports metrics like
            minutes played, usage rating, last 3 average, opponent rating, player skill rating etc.,. To make predictions easier
            we also plot the the important metrics for each player against DFS points scored in this season.
        </p>

        <p>
            The plots can be accessed by clicking on the player name in our prediction model. In the picture below
            the <b>`black`</b> line indicates the metric value for the current game and <b>`green`</b> line signifies the score needed to exceed 6x value for
            Demarcus Cousins.
        </p>
       <img style="width: 75%;height: auto;padding-left: 17%; opacity: 1" src="/img/common/RRF-DeMarcus Cousins-MP.jpg">
        <p>
            The plot shows that since Cousins moved to Pelicans his MP have dropped significantly and he's not likely to
            reach his 6x value and is a bad pick.

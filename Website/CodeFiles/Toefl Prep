What are the qualities of a good boss at a job?

Being a good boss or supervisor is an extremely tough and demanding task. The supervisor is responsible for the project, quality of the project, meeting project deadlines and keeping the morale of the team high while retaining employees and customers. To accomplish all these tasks, a supervisor has to have high emotional intelligence, confidence in his abilities and of his team, progress oriented and has to be charismatic to lead the team. 

Since a supervisor or a boss is generally responsible for a large team one of the most basic needs of a good supervisor is emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence, in my opinion entails being emphathetic to the state of his team members and providing guidance whenever required. If a supervisor is not emphathetic and does not care for his team members, the team productivity might fall and the churn rate within the team will be high. As we all know that hiring a new employee is a very challenging task, a good supervisor will focus on building his team and improving the team's skill to increase their productivity.
